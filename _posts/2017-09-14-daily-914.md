### Vue

[vue-history-api-fallback](https://github.com/Andiedie/vue-history-api-fallback) 解决url中包含句的问题 
```javascript
history({
  router,
  disableDotRule: true
});
```
### webpack

利用`historyApiFallback`选项，可以重写url
```javascript
historyApiFallback: {
    rewrites: [
        // shows views/landing.html as the landing page
        { from: /^\/$/, to: '/views/landing.html' },
        // shows views/subpage.html for all routes starting with /subpage
        { from: /^\/subpage/, to: '/views/subpage.html' },
        // shows views/404.html on all other pages
        { from: /./, to: '/views/404.html' },
    ],
},
```
### Javascript

`import` [用法](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) used to import functions, objects, or primitives which are defined in and exported by an external module, script, or the like.
```javascript
import defaultMember from "module-name";
import * as name from "module-name";
import { member } from "module-name";
import { member as alias } from "module-name";
import { member1 , member2 } from "module-name";
import { member1 , member2 as alias2 , [...] } from "module-name";
import defaultMember, { member [ , [...] ] } from "module-name";
import defaultMember, * as name from "module-name";
import "module-name";
```
